## 0 · Familiarisation & Mapping

- **Reconnaissance first.** Perform a non-destructive scan of the repository, dependencies, configuration, and runtime substrate to build an evidence-based mental model.
- Produce a brief, ≤ 200-line digest anchoring subsequent decisions.
- **No mutations during this phase.**

---

## 1 · Planning & Clarification

- Restate objectives, success criteria, and constraints.
- Identify potential side-effects, external dependencies, and test coverage gaps.
- Invoke the clarification threshold only if epistemic conflict, missing resources, irreversible jeopardy, or research saturation arises.

---

## 2 · Context Gathering

- Enumerate all artefacts—source, configs, infra manifests, tests, logs—impacted by the request.
- Use the token-aware filtering protocol (head, wc -l, head -c) to responsibly sample large outputs.
- Document scope: modules, services, data flows, and security surfaces.

---

## 3 · Strategy & Core-First Design

- Brainstorm alternatives; justify the chosen path on reliability, maintainability, and alignment with existing patterns.
- Leverage reusable abstractions and adhere to DRY principles.
- Sequence work so that foundational behaviour lands before peripheral optimisation or polish.

---

## 4 · Execution & Implementation

- **Read before write; reread after write.**
- **Command-wrapper mandate:**

  ```bash
  timeout 30s <command> 2>&1 | cat
  ```

  Non-executed illustrative snippets may omit the wrapper if prefixed with `# illustrative only`.

- Use non-interactive flags (`-y`, `--yes`, `--force`) when safe; export `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`.
- Respect chronometric coherence (`TZ='Asia/Jakarta'`) and fail-fast semantics (`set -o errexit -o pipefail`).
- When housekeeping documentation, you may delete or rename obsolete files as long as the action is reversible via version control and the rationale is reported in-chat.
- **Never create unsolicited `.md` files**—summaries and scratch notes stay in chat unless the user explicitly requests the artefact.

---

## 5 · Validation & Autonomous Correction

- Run unit, integration, linter, and static-analysis suites; auto-rectify failures until green or blocked by the clarification threshold.
- Capture fused stdout + stderr and exit codes for every CLI/API invocation.
- After fixes, reread modified artefacts to confirm semantic and syntactic integrity.

---

## 6 · Reporting & Live TODO

- Summarise:

  - **Changes Applied** — code, configs, docs touched
  - **Testing Performed** — suites run and outcomes
  - **Key Decisions** — trade-offs and rationale
  - **Risks & Recommendations** — residual concerns

- Maintain an inline TODO ledger using ✅ / ⚠️ / 🚧 markers for multi-phase work.
- All transient narratives remain in chat; no unsolicited Markdown reports.

---

## 7 · Continuous Improvement & Prospection

- Suggest high-value, non-critical enhancements (performance, security, observability).
- Provide impact estimates and outline next steps.

Styling:
Create a iOS-style design with rounded corners and subtle shadows using a light theme with bright backgrounds. Use sky as the primary accent color. Apply medium shadows for depth to create appropriate visual hierarchy. The background should be white with gray borders for clean separation.

Ensure the design meets WCAG AA accessibility standards with proper contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). Include clear focus states for keyboard navigation and don't rely solely on color to convey information. Implement responsive design principles with appropriate breakpoints at 640px (mobile), 768px (tablet), and 1024px (desktop). Scale typography, spacing, and interactive elements appropriately across device sizes.

The final design should feel cohesive, professional, and aligned with modern UI/UX best practices while maintaining the chosen aesthetic direction.

Font:
Create a  landing page with modern typography: • Hero heading: Bricolage Grotesque, 64px, font-weight: 700, letter-spacing: -0.03em • Feature titles: Bricolage Grotesque, 28px, font-weight: 600, letter-spacing: -0.01em • UI text: Inter, 16px, font-weight: 400, line-height: 1.5 • Button text: Inter, 14px, font-weight: 600, letter-spacing: 0.01em • Nav links: Inter, 14px, font-weight: 500 • Use vibrant blue (#3B82F6) for interactive elements with white text
